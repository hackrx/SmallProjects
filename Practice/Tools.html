          <h3 class="header-space">BUNDLE PHOBIA</h3>
          <p>
            This is a web application that allows you to determine how much npm
            package will add to your total bundle size. If you are working with
            a modern front-end framework, you want to try and keep the bundle
            size as small as possible to optimize the initial page load to new
            users.Bundle Phobia makes it easy to analyze the addition of a new
            dependency to your project.What you need to do is just enter the
            package name and it will tell you the bundle size , the number of
            download times, weather or not it is a tree shaker bowl as well as a
            bunch of other information for every single version of that package
            and you can even upload your entire package JSON to see all of your
            dependencies ranked by size.

          <h3>Figma</h3>
          <p>
            Figma is the most used well known app which I also personally use.I
            have used Adobe illustrator for design but I switched to Figma
            because it the the best platform for design.It can offer you 10
            times more value then illustrator, and it actually delivers it in a
            variety of way. Figma allows you to draw graphics, create mock-ups
            for your apps.It provides you desktop as well as a web app, which
            makes you ti design one time and use it anywhere on any machine. It
            is similar to sketch provides you all the basic stuff you need to
            design.By using this you can even export the css property of an
            element which you have designed. Also you can take out xml code for
            Android or IOS style.
