//Understanidng concept of css grid
 Css grid property can be used to arrange the items accordingly.


 First you need  to make a div or section element and make inside elements as childs
 which you want to show in grid.
 let us suppose eg.

 <div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">5</div>
  <div class="grid-item">6</div>
  <div class="grid-item">7</div>
  <div class="grid-item">8</div>
  <div class="grid-item">9</div>
</div>

Observe this carefully you have made a parent div element with a class name grid()

now .grid-container is the parent class and and you can use display: grid;
to make the grid view.
1.In grid system you have total 12 columns to adjust on a sigle row.
2.and you can adjust the elements to cover the no. of columns accordingly.
3.You can also adjust gap between columns.
4.You can also arrange items to show in a particular row.

4:  grid-column: 1/5;//it will take the 1/5 size of whole row
  : grid-column: 6/9; // this particular column starts from 6th part of the column and stretch upto 9th part
  : 
    grid-column: 10/12; //it will start from 10 part of the column and stretch upto 12th part
    grid-row:2; //it will put this element in second row.

3: gap:10px //it should be written in parent class to make gap of 10px between columns.
 fr is the fraction unit you can use to dive the columns according to percentage.

 grid-template-columns:repeat(3,1fr);


eg.

.display-grid{
    display:grid;
    
}
