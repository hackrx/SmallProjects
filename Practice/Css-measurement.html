                <h3>Let's talk about Rem</h3>
                <p>
                  Rem basically stands for relative to something. Rem is always relative
                  to root element, which is basically html elements.On the other side, em
                  is relative to parent element. Default size for HTML element is
                  <span>16px</span> which is equal to 1rem. User can actually control the
                  font size from the browser settings, through which if you have used rem
                  for an element then it will automatically resize it according to browser
                  settings or it is set by default to <span>16px</span>.
                </p>
            </div>
         
        </div>
        <div class="em-container">
            <div>
                <h3>Now let's talk about Em</h3>
                <p>
                  Em is not relative to root element as rem does but it is relative to its
                  parent elements.clock And is there is no parent element of that
                  particular element then em will behaves like rem. But it will not do the
                  same when you change the browser settings i.e view large, view normal ,
                  view small.

    <div class="vh-vw-container">
         
    <div class="vh-container">
        <div>
          <h3>What is vh??</h3>
          <p>
            vh is stands for view port height.If you are setting size of an element
            20vh , it means you are assigning it to cover the 20 view port height of
            the page which is pretty interesting, isn't it. Let's take screen is of
            100vh size, then after assigning an element 20vh it will take 20 percent
            of total height.And if you assign it as 100vh then it will take the 100
            percent of the page size which by means covers the whole page.
          </p>
        </div>

      <div class="vw-container">
        <div>
          <h3>What is vw stands for?</h3>
          <p>
            vw stands for view port width.Pretty similar to vh, but vh is used for
            height purpose and vw is for width.It also depends on width of page.If
            you are assigns 20vw to an element then it will take 20 percent width of
            the page. vh, vw, rem and em makes the page responsive.So I suggest you
            to start using rem and em units instead of px.
